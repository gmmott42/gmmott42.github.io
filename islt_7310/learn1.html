           <h3>The Beginning of Understanding</h3>
           <br><br>
           <p>The first concept we will talk about is the 6 major Tools of Geography. The first tool we will learn about are maps. Maps are a major tool because they are what allow geographers to know what is out there when exploring a region. Maps come in all shapes and sizes and it is important to learn about all major maps. Next, we look at Globes and the importance they hold in geography. These 3D objects allow the geographer to see a map and create a correspondence that makes sense. After globes, we focus on the Atlas, or a collection of maps in one book, that allows the geographer to gain lots of information in a short amount of time. Moving away from maps we then begin to focus on actual imagery of a location and this can be accomplished with two different ideas: satellite and aerial photography. These two kinds of images allow a geographer to gain a real- understanding of the location they are going to before they get there. Are there any issues they will run into or are there locations they have to visit? The goal of imagery is to show the geographer the exact idea of what is in front of them. The fifth major tool is Information Graphics, which are pictures designed to show information. If you take a graph and show the height of mountains compared to one another you would have an information graphic. Finally, you have Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, which are simply computer programs designed to simulate geographic data.
