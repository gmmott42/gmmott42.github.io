           <h3>Looking at the other side of Earth</h3>
           <br><br>
           <p>When looking across the pond we get to two very distinct, yet very important, regions of the world in Europe and Russia. These two regions of the world are steeped in culture and history but they are not without their controversies. We are going to look at all of that and more in this module. Our goal when exploring these regions is to make sure we are asking ourselves how history was impacted when these two areas began to expand. Next, we begin to look towards Asia and break this down into two separate geographic regions with the first one we are looking at being Monsoon Asia. The region includes the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and China and sees a similar climate. Continuing our trip to Asia, we begin to look at the rest of the Asian continent and the Middle East to learn more about this area. This part of the world is broken down into various regions and historical events that keep the regions together. When we think of this region we tend to focus on just the Middle East but this area covers so much more than that. Moving on to the continent of Africa we begin to see how history and geography combine to impact the citizens that are living there. Africa can be broken up into 5 separate geographic regions: Sahara, Sahel, Ethiopian Highlands, Savanna, and the Swahili Coast. Finally, on to the continent of Australia and Oceania, we will be wrapping up the end of the year by saving the best for last. This is a place rich in history and culture, we are going to explore both and how they compare to our own.
