    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Mr. Mott and I am going to be your guide through geography. I am beginning my sixth year in education and this year I am teaching 5th graders. I have taught kindergarten through 5th grade, special education, and 7th grade world geography. <br/>When thinking about the content of this course a quote from Robert Burdette (an American humorist) comes to mind, <blockquote>“Don’t believe the World owes you a living. The World owes you nothing, it was here first”.</blockquote> This quote is not to <strong>discourage you</strong> or <strong>dissuade you</strong> from achieving your dreams, rather it is to simply remind you <em>your dreams are yours for the taking!</em>
    <p>I have a degree from Missouri State University in Elementary Education with an emphasis in Middle School Social Studies and English. I am in the Online Education program at the University of Missouri and am currently in my final semester expected to graduate in May of 2022</p>
