    My name is Michael and I live in Springfield, Missouri. I have a degree from Missouri State University in Elementary Education with an emphasis in Middle School Social Studies and English. I am in the Online Education program at the University of Missouri and am currently in my final semester expected to graduate in May of 2022. I am beginning my sixth year in education and this year I am teaching 5th graders. I have taught Kindergarten through 5th grade, Special Education, and 7th grade World Geography in my short career. This will be my first true experience with this side of web development, I have done some things with like Wix but nothing this in-depth. I am hoping to gain some understanding of the deeper side of HTML coding so I can keep working on the design side of things. I am actually possibly shifting out of the classroom and into the development side of education for another program offered by my district so this would be a crash course before I started that job. I am a huge fan of baseball, I root for the St. Louis Cardinals, and play quite a few video games, I can usually be found on the Xbox. When I am not at school I am reading, playing video games, or spending time with my goofy cat.
